Observing Exoplanet Atmospheres from Earth

In this project, we simulate data for Henrietta, a new near-infrared, low-resolution (R=200), high spectrophotometric precision spectrograph that aims to observe exoplanet
atmospheres from Earth. We simulate Henrietta's differential spectroscopy method, which will will simultaneously take spectra of two stars and divide their light curves to 
remove noise added from Earth's precipitable water vapor, increasing the accuracy of transit measurements.
