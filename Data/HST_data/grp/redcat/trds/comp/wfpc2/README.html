<h2>Introduction</h2><p>

The SYNPHOT package in STSDAS has three primary uses: 1) to provide
photometric calibration information, which is inserted  by the
calibration software into image headers: (keywords photflam,  photbw,
etc), 2) to estimate exposure times for HST observations and, 3) to use
synthetic photometry to calibrate observations. <p>

<h2><A name="history"> History of SYNPHOT Table Updates</A></h2><p>

<pre>
date		reason for update 

Jan 1999	UV contamination tables updated
May 1997	all UV modes updated, some redward ones as well
June 1996	minor update, affects fqch4p15, fqch4n15, fquvn* only
July 1995	major update, all obsmodes affected
End of 1993	prelaunch population of tables

</pre>

<ul>Jan 1999 Update</ul> <p>

The WFPC2 time-dependent photometric calibration tables (wfpc2_cont*)
in SYNPHOT have been updated. Note that the contamination tables are
not used by calwp2 but must be invoked manually in SYNPHOT.

Updates were based upon an analysis of the WFPC2 stellar photometric
monitoring data obtained over the last four years. The new analysis
showed that, for bright targets, (1) the long-term photometric
throughput continues to be quite stable: fluctuations are ~2% or less
peak-to-peak over 4 years in filters longwards of and including F336W,
(2) the UV throughput has gradually evolved, that is, the clean count
rates (immediately after the decons) have increased over the 4 years in
some filters, e.g., F160BW by ~12% in the PC, and F170W by ~9%, while
decreasing slightly in others, e.g., F255W by ~3% and, (3) the
contamination growth rates have slowed slightly for the UV filters,
e.g., ~1% per day to 0.5% per day in F160BW on the PC. More details on
the SYNPHOT contamination table  update can be found in  <A
href="http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/instrument_news/WFPC2/Wfpc2_isr/wfpc2_isr9803.html">
ISR 98-03. </A>

<p>

<ul>May 1997 Update</ul><p>

Based upon calibration data of grw+70d5824, all UV filters shortward of
F439W were updated as well as some of the more frequently-used
broadband filters redward of F439W (F450W, F555W, F606W, F675W, F702W,
F785LP, F791W, F814W, F850LP, and F1042M). Changes were installed in
the OPUS pipeline May 16,1997. The changes are described in detail in
<A href="http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/instrument_news/WFPC2/Wfpc2_isr/wfpc2_isr9710.html">
ISR 97-10.</A>

 <p>

In addition, a couple of bugs in the tables (which had been effectively
canceling each other out) were corrected: the WFPC2 obstruction factor
and the aperture correction are now included in the wfpc2_optics table.
In previous versions, the SYNPHOT tables were intended to be for 0.5"
data, but due to the missing obscuration factor, mimicked data measured
at 3". The new wfpc2_optics table was generated by multiplying its
throughput by 0.9108 (WFPC2 obstruction) and dividing by the aperture
correction (10^(-apcorr/2.5). NOTE: aperture correction used at all
wavelengths was 10%.  <p>

With a few exceptions, changes to non-UV filter modes were relatively
minor: generally ~1-2% or less (F785LP, F850LP, and F1042M were more:
~1-4%, ~1-6$, and ~2-15% for them respectively, depending on the
chip.). The UV filters required somewhat larger changes to bring
SYNPHOT into agreement with the observations, ranging from ~2% (e.g.,
F255W and F300W) to ~5% (F170W, F218W) to 10% or more (F160BW, F375N).
Any filters not updated at this time will be checked with future
observations (planned for summer of 1997) and updated if necessary. 
<p>

<ul>June 1996 Update</ul><p>

Based upon calibration data of grw+70d5824, the methane and [OII]
filter tables were updated to yield improved SYNPHOT countrate
predictions when compared to the observations. <p>

Tables affected were: filter curves for fqch4p15, fqch4n15, and fquvn*.
Note that the unrotated methane quad (fqch4n) was not changed; it will
be updated when additional calibration data becomes available. The new
tables are available for ftp retrieval; changes will take effect in the
routine pipeline end of June 1996. Filter tables were multiplied by:

<pre>
filter+aperture		FOV	wavelength	scaled by
fquvn,wf2		wf2	  3986		  0.913
fquvn,wf3		wf3	  3916		  0.865
fquvn,wf4		wf4	  3839		  0.938
fquvn33,fquvn33		wf2	  3763		  1.038

fqch4n33,fqch4n33	wf2/3	  6193		  0.949
fqch4n15,fqch4n15	pc1	  6193		  0.949
fqch4n,fqch4w3		wf3	  8929		  0.698
fqch4p15,fqch4p15	pc1	  8929		  0.698
</pre>

<ul>July 1995 Update</ul><p>

A major WFPC2-related update was done in July 1995 and all files are
available for ftp retrieval; the changes will take effect in the
routine PODPS pipeline in Aug 1995.  The new tables bring SYNPHOT into
general agreement with the results presented in the <A 
href="Wfpc2_hand/wfpc2_handbook.html"> WFPC2 Instrument Handbook </A>
(Version 3.0, June 1995) and in Photometric Performance and Calibration
of WFPC2 by Holtzman et al.

(PASP 107,1065).</A>
<p>

Tables affected include the wfpc2_optics, dqe curves, contamination
correction tables, and many, but not all, filter transmissions (see
Holtzman paper).<p>

<h2><A name="tables">SYNPHOT Tables and Pipeline Processing</A></h2><p>

The pipeline calibration software  <A
href="http://www.stsci.edu/documents/dhb/web/c30_wfpc2calib.fm1.html">calwp2
</A> uses the wfpc2-related SYNPHOT tables to populate the photometric
keywords in the calibrated header (c0h); the data itself is not
changed.  The keywords used are:<p>

<pre>
keyword		description			example

PHOTMODE	Photometry mode			WFPC2,1,A2D7,F300W,,CAL
PHOTFLAM	Inverse sensitivity 		5.926793E-17 
PHOTZPT		Zero point			-21.1 mag
PHOTPLAM	Pivot wavelength		2990.016 &Aring
PHOTBW		RMS bandwidth of the filter	324.5099 &Aring
GRAPHTAB	HST graphtable used in pipeline f7d1401pm.tmg
COMPTAB		HST comptable used in pipeline	f7d1400mm.tmc
</pre>

The PHOTFLAM is the flux conversion factor, the flux that produces 1
count/sec in the passband.  These are all group keywords (accessible
via STSDAS task hedit or imhead, for example), so that there is a set
for each chip used. <p>

The graphtab/comptabs names used in the pipeline are based on the time
of installation; for the July 1995 update, the GRAPHTAB and COMPTAB
names should be f7* or later (f=year since 1980, 7 is month, d is day).
Note: other instruments use the graph and comp tables as well, so there
may be new tables installed in the pipeline after July 1995 but these
will contain the same wfpc2-related data as the f7d* tables above.  Any
future wfpc2 changes will be documented in this readme file.<p>

The c0h header file from the pipeline contains HISTORY keywords which
provide a detailed list of the SYNPHOT table versions that were used to
populate the photometric keywords, for example, the SYNPHOT HISTORY
keywords for PC1 in an f300w observation:<p>

<pre>
HISTORY   The following throughput tables were used:
          crotacomp$hst_ota_005.tab, 
HISTORY   crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_optics_003.tab,
          crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_f300w_003.tab,    
HISTORY   crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_dqepc1_002.tab,
          crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_a2d7pc1_002.tab,  
HISTORY   crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_flatpc1_001.tab      
</pre>

If you are using STSDAS SYNPHOT software directly, the showfiles task
provides a quick check of the tables that would be used by SYNPHOT
tasks. For the example above:<p>

<pre>
> showfiles wfpc2,1,a2d7,f300w,cal
crotacomp$hst_ota_005.tab
crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_optics_003.tab
crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_f300w_003.tab
crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_dqepc1_002.tab
crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_a2d7pc1_002.tab
crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_flatpc1_001.tab
</pre>

where "crotacomp" and "crwfpc2comp" are the directories containing the
named tables.  <p>

<hr size=3><p>

<h2><A name="updating">Updating Calibrated Pipeline Files with New SYNPHOT Results</A></h2><p>

If you've ascertained from the c0h file (via GRAPHTAB and COMPTAB names
or HISTORY records or <A href="http://www.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/cdbs/getref.cgi"> getref </A>) that the most recent SYNPHOT tables were not
used, you may wish to recalibrate.  This can be done by either using
calwp2 after editing the appropriate keywords (DOPHOTOM, GRAPHTAB,
COMPTAB) or by running SYNPHOT directly. If you're already planning on
executing calwp2 for other reasons, the first method may be easier; if
you don't need to run calwp2, the SYNPHOT task <A href="http://ra.stsci.edu/documents/SyG/SG_12.html#HEADING26">bandpar</A> may be used in
conjunction with the PHOTMODE header keyword to obtain the values that
would have gone into the rest of the photometric keywords.  For the
f300w example above, retrieve photmode keyword with hedit, then run
bandpar.  To differentiate the iraf commands from output, we've
prefaced command lines with the IRAF prompt symbol ">".<p>

<pre>
> hedit *101t.c0h[1] photmode . 
u2ou0101t.c0h[1],PHOTMODE = WFPC2,1,A2D7,F300W,,CAL

> bandpar wfpc2,1,a2d7,f300w,cal output="" photlist=all wavetab=""
# OBSMODE                      URESP          PIVWV          BANDW

# OBSMODE                      TPEAK          EQUVW          RECTW

wfpc2,1,a2d7,f300w,cal     5.8289E-14        3010.7      0.0025022
</pre>
 
The output is defined in detail in the online bandpar help and in the
<A href="http://ra.stsci.edu/Document.html">SYNPHOT User's Guide</A>; the bandpar output is related to the photometry
header keywords:<p>

<pre>
PHOTFLAM == URESP
PHOTPLAM == PIVWV
PHOTBW   == BANDW
PHOTZPT  == is always -21.1 mag
</pre>

For record-keeping, if you wish to update your headers with the bandpar
results, the stsdas task hedit is best:<p>

<pre>
> hedit u2ou0101t.c0h[1] photflam value="5.9268E-17" 
> hedit u2ou0101t.c0h[1] photplam value="2990."
</pre>

etc.<p>

If narrowband filters were used, we recommend you generate your own
wavetab (the default stepsize is sometimes not small enough for some of
the narrower filters).  The wavelength table can be constructed with
the SYNPHOT task "genwave" and used as the wavetab in the bandpar
expression; for example:<p>

<pre>
> genwave output=wave.tab minwave=1000. 
          maxwave=10000. dwave=1.
> bandpar wfpc2,1,a2d7,f300w,cal output="" 
          photlist=all wavetab=wave.tab
</pre>

None of the SYNPHOT tasks will change the wavetab in any way, so once
you've generated one, it can be used for all of your SYNPHOT 
computations.<p>

<hr size=3><p>

<h2><A name="estimating">Estimating Exposure Times</A></h2><p>

The main SYNPHOT routine for estimating exposure times is calcphot,
which is a very powerful and versatile task; below is just one example
of the many ways in which it may be used.  You will need to have the
SYNPHOT tables available as well as any spectra that you are interested
in using. All the tables in the cdbs directories are in the form of
binary STSDAS tables. 

Some of the spectral directories are:<p>

<pre>
calspec		spectra of HST flux calibration targets
bkmodels	stellar flux spectra calculated by Kurucz and Buser
bpgs		Bruzual et al. spectral (extension of Gunn/Stryker optical atlas)
bz77		Bruzual stellar spectra
gunnstryker	from observations of Gunn and Stryker (ApJSupp 52,121)
jacobi		from observations of Jacoby et al (ApJSupp 56,257)
</pre>

All <A
href="http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/instrument_news/Observatory/cdbs/astronomical_catalogs_alt.html">spectra are accessible via the CDBS
pages</A> or via anonymous ftp to ftp.stsci.edu.  Each of these
directories have README files, with short listings of table names,
objects, and spectral types.  Before retrieving all tables, you may
wish to view these README files to select only certain spectra. For
example, after ftp'ing to stsci.edu anonymous:<p>

<pre>
cd cdbs/grid/bpgs
get README
!page README
</pre>

shows:<p>

<pre>
#  Spectral types are taken from Gunn and Stryker
#  paper, ApJ Supplement 52:121-153, 1983 June

bpgs_4.tab       BD-01D935        B1V
...
</pre>

Remember to type "binary" at the ftp prompt before retrieving any of
these tables, since these are STSDAS tables.<p>

The <A href="http://ra.stsci.edu/documents/SyG/SG_45.html#HEADING125">Appendix B of the SYNPHOT User's
Guide</A> discusses all the SYNPHOT tasks in more detail and the
Appendices discuss the available spectra in more detail.

If the online spectra aren't sufficient, you may also generate your
own, for example, by using the SYNPHOT calcspec task, which can create
blackbody, powerlaw, and rectangular, to name a few.  Type "help
calcspec" at the iraf prompt or see the 
<A href="http://ra.stsci.edu/Document.html">SYNPHOT User's Guide</A> for more
details about its capabilities.<p>
 
Once you have the spectra, calcphot can be used to obtain a countrate:<p>

<pre>
> calcphot wfpc2,1,a2d7,f300w spectrum="grw_70d5824_003.tab" 
           form=counts

Mode = band(wfpc2,1,a2d7,f300w)
Pivot       Equiv Gaussian
Wavelength         FWHM
 2990.012        764.1473    band(wfpc2,1,a2d7,f300w)
Spectrum:  /tib/cdbs/calspec/grw_70d5824_003.tab
  VZERO      (COUNTS s<sup>-1</sup> hstarea<sup>-1</sup>)
    0.           2275.741
</pre>		
 
Note that if you do not specify an a2d gain, the result is in
electrons; the output reads "(COUNTS s<sup>-1</sup> hstarea<sup>-1</sup>)" regardless of
whether the result is in electrons or DN.  Note, too, that the July
1995 SYNPHOT tables already contain the flatfield component in the
filter tables, so adding "cal" to the obsmode will not change the
countrate.  <p>

To have calcphot include the contamination effect, you must add the
cont# keyword to the obsmode.  The STSDAS epoch task converts date to
Modified Julian Date, MJD.  For example, the June 1995 decon occurred
June 2; to compute the decrease in throughput 21 days after a typical
decon, run calcphot using MJD for June 24:<p>

<pre>
> epoch "june 24,1995" qual="" dmy_style=mdy printout=date,mjd
 24 Jun 1995 00:00:00.00000            SAT
MJD  49892.0000000000

> calcphot wfpc2,1,a2d7,f300w,cont#49892.0 
           spectrum="grw_70d5824_003.tab" form=counts

Mode = band(wfpc2,1,a2d7,f300w,cont#49892.0)
Pivot       Equiv Gaussian

 VZERO      (COUNTS s<sup>-1</sup> hstarea<sup>-1</sup>)
    0.           2202.372
</pre>   

Check the online iraf help (type "help calcphot") or the
<A href="http://ra.stsci.edu/Document.html">SYNPHOT User's Guide</A> for details on the variations possible with the calcphot task. 
For example, the calcspec/calphot step can be combined by giving a
filename to calcphot's spectrum parameter; the file should contain the
some function commands you would have given calcspec.<p>

More details on exposure time estimation can be found in the  <A

<hr size=3><p>

<h2><A name="summary">Summary of SYNPHOT Tables</A></h2><p>

To run SYNPHOT for wfpc2-related observations, you will need the 2
general tables (graph and comp tables), the wfpc2-related tables, and
any necessary spectral data tables (discussed in section on Estimating
Exposure Times, above).  <p>

The graph and comp tables (tmg, tmc) can be found in:<p>
<pre> 
<A href="http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/cdbs/cdbs2/mtab/">mtab</A>$ (ie, h5g10115m.tmc,h5l1440cm.tmg)
</pre>

The name is a timestamp for installation into the routine pipeline
processing system (f=year, 7=month, d is day).<p>

The graphtab entries correlate keywords from the observation mode with
component table rootnames; generally these do not change much, unless
new observation modes are added.  For example, the "f1042m" keyword in
an observation mode will point to a component table rootname: 
"wfpc2_f1042m".<p>

The comptab entries correlate the component table rootname from
graphtab with specific filenames; for the f1042m example, the component
table rootname "wfpc2_f1042m" points to the file 
"crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_f1042m_003.tab", where the name preceding the '$'
refers to the directory, and the name after refers to the specific file
SYNPHOT will use for an f1042m observation.<p>

WFPC2-related tables consist of:<p>

<pre>
hst_ota
wfpc2_optics
a2d   (separate ones for each gain and chip)
dqe   (efficiency tables, one for each chip)
flat  (flatfield table; currently these are dummy tables 
       set to 1, as the flatfield information is already 
       contained in the wfpc2 optics table)
filter tables (one for each filter element, names like: 
       wfpc2_f300w_003, where 003 refers to version number 
       of table)
cont  (contamination tables, invoked with "cont#" in the 
       obsmode, one per chip)
</pre>

For a typical observation mode, you will normally see at least the ota,
optics, filter, dqe tables in the path; specifying "cal", "a2d7" (or
"a2d15"), and "cont#" followed by MJD, you will also see the flat, a2d,
and cont tables.  For example:<p>

<pre>
> showfiles wfpc2,3,f555w          
crotacomp$hst_ota_005.tab
crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_optics_003.tab
crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_f555w_003.tab
crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_dqewfc3_002.tab

> showfiles "wfpc2,3,f555w,a2d15,cal,cont#49943.0"
crotacomp$hst_ota_005.tab
crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_optics_003.tab
crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_f555w_003.tab
crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_dqewfc3_002.tab
crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_a2d15wf3_002.tab
crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_flatwf3_001.tab
crwfpc2comp$wfpc2_contwf3_005.tab[cont#]
</pre>

Note that if you wish to include the contamination tables, you must
enclose the obsmode in quotes.<p>

<hr size=3><p>

<h2><A name="retrieve">Retrieving the Files</A></h2><p>

Note that all SYNPHOT tables are in binary STSDAS format, readable only
with tasks in the IRAF/STSDAS ttools and SYNPHOT packages.  The history
and version of each new table is included in the table header, which
can be viewed with, for example, tdump:<p>

<pre>     
	> tdump wfpc2_f555w_003.tab | page
</pre>

The new tables are available via ftp to stsci.edu, in cdbs/cdbs2/comp/ <p>
or from the direct link
<A href="http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/cdbs/cdbs2/comp/">www.stsci.edu/ftp/cdbs/cdbs2/comp/</A><p>

Note: the tarfile includes the recent May 1997 graph and comp tables,
which were the earliest tables to contain the most recent wfpc2-related
SYNPHOT update.  If you intend to use SYNPHOT for other instruments as
well, you may wish to retrieve the most recent graph and comp tables,

not, please see References), once back on your system, unpack the
tarfile: <p>

<pre>
tar xvf wfpc2tar
</pre>

Set some logicals within IRAF:<p>

<pre>
> set mtab=localdir	  - for directory containing graph/comp tabs
> set crotacomp=localdir  - dir containing ota file
> set crwfpc2comp=local   - dir containing wfpc2 files
</pre>

Point SYNPHOT to these new files, from within IRAF type:<p>

<pre>
> unlearn refdata
</pre>

which will set refdata parameters to:<p>

<pre>
refdata.area = 45238.93416
refdata.grtbl = "mtab$*.tmg"
refdata.cmptbl = "mtab$*.tmc"
refdata.mode = "a"
</pre>

where the graph and comptab pointers will choose the latest timestamp
file in the previously defined mtab directory; or, you can insert the
entire table name by:<p>

<pre>
> epar refdata
</pre>

and editing in the appropriate names (ie, crcomp$hstgraph_950712a.tab
for grtbl, etc).<p>
